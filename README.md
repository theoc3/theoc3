# About Me

Hi I'm Theo, a Sophomore at BU majoring in CS and minoring in Japanese. My favorite CS field is the overlap between linguistics and CS, 
but I'll always have a soft spot for game development. Check out my <a href="https://talcgames.itch.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">itch.io</a>! page for my game jam stuff.
