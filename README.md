# About Me

Hi I'm Theo, a Junior at BU majoring in CS and minoring in Japanese. I'm most interested in the overlap between linguistics and CS, 
but I'll always have a soft spot for game development. Check out my <a href="https://talcgames.itch.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">itch.io</a> page for my game jam stuff. I really like stationery too, so you can check out my stationery blog (made in Next.js wow) at <a href="https://theosbungu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">theosbungu.com</a>.
